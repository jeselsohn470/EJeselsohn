Built a Movie Reccomender System for my Machine Learning final project.

Implemented a Basline, Simple and Hybrid model.

Included a write up which includes:

  a. A section analyzing the different methods of building a Recommender System.
  
  b. A section, primarily based on my research, on why I chose the particular algorithm for my basic and hybrid Recommender.
  
  c. A section that details my final analysis on my Recommenders performance.
